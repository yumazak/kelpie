/**
 * Guards a positional or id-addressed scope resolution across a collection shrink. The scope
 * re-resolves inside the store notification, before the binding's queued
 * render can unmount it, so a shrink briefly reads out of bounds; `resolve`
 * serves the last valid item for exactly that window. Every stale serve
 * schedules an expiry through `scheduleExpiry` carrying the generation it
 * observed: a valid resolution in between advances the generation and voids
 * the pending expiry, while a provider still mounted out of bounds after the
 * flush has its cache dropped and `reportStale` run once (its next resolution
 * then throws, like a never-valid index does immediately). The expiry only
 * drops the cache; descendants keep the last committed state until the next
 * store notification re-resolves the scope. `scheduleExpiry` runs its
 * callback after the binding's current render flush settles (Vue's
 * `nextTick`, for example). Pass `reportStale: null` when a sibling cache
 * over the same validity predicate already reports.
