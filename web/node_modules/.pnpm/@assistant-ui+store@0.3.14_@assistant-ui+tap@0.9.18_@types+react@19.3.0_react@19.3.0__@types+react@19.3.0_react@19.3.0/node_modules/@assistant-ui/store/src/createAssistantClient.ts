/**
 * Creates an `AssistantClient` outside any UI framework.
 *
 * The client's scopes run as tap resources inside a standalone tap root; no
 * React renderer is involved. This is the construction seam for non-React
 * bindings: a framework bridge creates the handle, reads the current client
 * with `getClient`, re-reads it whenever `subscribe` fires (a structural
 * change produces a new client object, a value-only update keeps its
 * identity), and holds a subscription for as long as it needs the client
 * alive.
 *
 * The handle's lifecycle rides its subscriber count. Scopes render lazily on
 * the first read and mount when the first subscriber attaches; state updates
 * before that throw, so an imperative consumer without a reactive framework
 * holds a no-op subscription. When the last subscriber releases, the root
 * soft-unmounts on the next task: effects clean up, state is retained, and a
 * later subscriber remounts the same scopes. `destroy` is the permanent
 * teardown, synchronous while subscribers are attached; after the last
 * release it defers to the soft unmount that release already scheduled.
 * Releasing every subscription is the ordinary path.
 *
 * The parent may be a plain client or another source/handle. Passing a source
 * keeps the child bound to the parent's current client across the parent's
 * structural changes without remounting the child's scopes.
 *
 * The config may be a plain value, captured at creation, or an
 * {@link AssistantConfigSource} that is re-read in the root render whenever it
 * notifies, so a binding can deliver config changes (updated element args,
 * added or removed scopes) without remounting the surviving scopes.
